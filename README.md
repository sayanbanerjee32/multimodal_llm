# Multi-Modal LLM Project Plan

## 1. Model Architecture
- Base: Phi Model
- Input Modalities: Text, Image, Audio
- Output: Text

## 2. Training

### 2.1 Image Processing
- Dataset: Instruct 150k
- Image Embedding: CLIP
- Options:
  a. Real-time processing (GPU-intensive)
  b. Preprocess and store embeddings
- Add projection layer: CLIP embeddings to Phi Model input
- Implement QLoRa adapter for training

### 2.2 Audio Processing
- Use Whisper for ASR
- Options:
  1. [Option details omitted for brevity]
  2. [Option details omitted for brevity]
  3. [Option details omitted for brevity]
  4. [Option details omitted for brevity]
- Add projection layer for Whisper output (text) to Phi Model input
- Implement pipeline to link audio processing to model

### 2.3 Text Processing
- Assume existing implementation

## 3. Training Process
- Train QLoRa adapter on Instruct 150k dataset
- Fine-tune projection layers if necessary

## 4. Deployment
- Create a Hugging Face Spaces Gradio app
- Design UI with Gradio components:
  - Text input (gr.Textbox)
  - Image upload (gr.Image)
  - Audio upload and recording (gr.Audio)
- Implement backend logic:
  - Load and initialize models (Phi, CLIP, Whisper)
  - Process inputs and generate responses
- Configure Spaces for model serving and real-time inference
- Optimize for Spaces resource constraints

## 5. Testing and Optimization
- Evaluate model performance on each modality
- Optimize inference speed and resource usage
- Conduct user testing and gather feedback

## 6. Documentation and Maintenance
- Create comprehensive README file including:
  - Project overview and objectives
  - Detailed architecture description
  - Installation and setup instructions
  - Usage guide with examples
  - Performance metrics and benchmarks
  - Full development logs and changelog
  - Potential improvements and future work
- Implement logging system for model performance and user interactions
- Set up monitoring dashboard for key metrics
- Establish regular update and maintenance schedule
- Create contribution guidelines for open-source collaboration
